# TÐ•esting the site with the help of a Puppeteer

 <!-- [START badges] -->
Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). 
Puppeteer runs [headless](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) 
by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.
